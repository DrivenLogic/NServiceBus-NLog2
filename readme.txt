A fork of nServiceBus 2.6 that seeks to support the following goals:

* Compiled against the latest Autofac 
* Compiled against latest NLog 2.X build 
* Removal of common logging and log4net

Note: Internally TopShelf dependencies still hold a reference to log4net
and Spring.core holds a reference to Common.logging
